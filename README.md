# typescript-lessons

Welcome lads. We are very happy you could join the ride in typescript, a javascript superset that focuses on type safety and enforces standards that help make the development of javascript much better and easier.
Each folder here has a brief description with sample code to help you get familiarized with typescript and hopefully give you inspiration to what you might be able to accomplish with typescript. Without much delay, let's dive right in.

## Installation

 before you can get started with typescript, you'll first need to install ```ts-node```
  a typescript library for running typescript natively in the terminals
  To install ```ts-node```, follow the guide below:

- Head over to your terminal (This is the same for whatever platform you might be on)
- Make sure you have node installed on your system. If you don't , follow this link to install it (node-js)[]
- In your terminal type in this command ```npm i ts-node``` to install ts-node on your machine. For those who use other package managers, you can search online on how the install is done though it's not so much different from ***npm***

## Getting Started

- Fork or download this repository unto your machine.
- Open it in your target machine and test out the code by typing out ```ts-node <name of file>```. Be careful of what folders you run the code from.
- Play around with the code. Delete and add as much as you want until you feel you've mastered the codes.

## Contibuting

This is a project I wish for many to benefit from and hence I'm opento anyone who would help out make this into someting great that everyone can benefit from
